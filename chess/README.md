# Chess in C

Custom implementation of chess in C using `SDL2`. It is still a work in progress, so mind it. 

# Dependencies

The only dependencies (for now) are `SDL2` and `SDL2_IMG`. In archlinux these can be installed with

```
sudo pacman -S sdl2
sudo pacman -S sdl2_image
```

# Compilation

Once you have the dependencies install simply do

```
cd ./src
make
./main
```

# Assets
